## Salaries prediction model using linear regression
- In this project we solve the task of salary prediction  of Employees with Machine Learning using Python.
- Generally we know salary is determined by the working experiance of a employee.
- we use Linear Regression to build a model  which is a supervised machine learning algorithm in machine learing.
## Model building steps <br>
1. Import necessary libraries - numpy, pandas, matplotlib,seaborn.
2. Load dataset inside jupyter notebook.
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Dataset and find useful information about attributes.
4. Using sklearn module split the dataset into training and testing part.
5. Build the model using Linear Regression algorithm.
6. Plot the outputs using matplotlib library.
7. calculate accuracy of model using r2_score library and calculate mean squared error.
8. finally find intercept and coefficent of linear regression line.
9. Salary prediction
